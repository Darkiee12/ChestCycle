# Chest Cycle Tracker

This website is designed to help players of Supercell games track their progress in a specific in-game cycle (like chest cycles, card cycles, etc.). It allows players to easily update and keep track of their current or recent state in the cycle using their browser's local storage.

## Features
- **Track Your Progress:** Easily update and track your current position in the game cycle.
- **Browser-based State Storage:** Your progress is stored locally in your browser, meaning there's no need to log in or create an account. The information stays on your device.
- **Self-Hosting Option:** You can clone this repository and host the tracker on your local machine, or use the live demo at the link provided.
  
## How to Use

1. **Live Demo:**
   You can access the live version of the tracker here: [Chest Cycle Tracker](https://darkiee12.github.io/ChestCycle/).

2. **Self-Hosting:**
   If you'd like to run this locally, you can clone the repository and open it in your browser. Hereâ€™s how:

   - Clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/darkiee12/ChestCycle.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:  
     ```bash
     cd ChestCycle
     ```
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the tracker.

## How It Works

- **Cycle Tracking:** Update your current progress in the cycle by entering the relevant data into the form on the website. Your progress will be saved automatically in your browser's local storage.
- **Local Storage:** The website uses local storage to persist the user's cycle data across browser sessions. The information is saved only on your device and is not accessible by anyone else.
